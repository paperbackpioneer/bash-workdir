# BASH-WORKDIR

When in your working directory, simply type:

``` bash
workdir
```

And, now, this is your defined working directory.

If you end up somewhere else, and need to jump there quickly,
type:

``` bash
gotowork
```

And bam! You're back at your work directory.

Import to your `bashrc` with the following line:

``` bash
. path/to/bash-workdir
```

Don't forget to change the path to the location of your
`bash-workdir` file.

Then, while in the terminal, type:

``` bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

(Or whatever is your config file)

That's it.
